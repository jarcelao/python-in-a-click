# What if we could setup Python `in one click`?

- No more conflicting Pythons
- No more conflicting packages
- No more random fiddling

---

## Python Dev Environment in a Box

- `uv` - Python version and package manager bundled into one
- `mise` - Manages dev tools, env vars, and tasks
- `devcontainer` - Containers as full-fledged dev environments

# Let's Try it Out!

---

## Some Points...

- This is not limited to Python
    - Any language and any tool (i.e. databases, services etc.) can work!

- You'll need to install a base set of tools
    - Docker Desktop + VSCode Dev Containers
    - GitHub Codespaces

- You'll need to maintain your setup scripts

## What Now?
